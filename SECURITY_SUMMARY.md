# SQL Bot Security - Quick Summary

## 🚨 Critical Security Issue Found

**Problem**: The bot currently executes **ANY** SQL query without checking if it's safe!

**Risk**: Users can accidentally (or intentionally):
- ❌ Delete all companies: "Delete test companies?"
- ❌ Update all records: "Set all companies to active?"
- ❌ Drop tables: "Remove the old table?"

**Current Status**: 🔴 **VULNERABLE** - Bot has `sa` permissions and executes everything

---

## ✅ What Queries Are Currently Allowed?

Right now the bot will execute **EVERYTHING** because there's no filtering.

### After applying security patch:

**✅ ALLOWED (Safe queries)**
```
"How many companies are there?"        → SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Companies
"List all active users?"                → SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Status = 'Active'
"Show companies with most documents?"   → SELECT ... (complex JOIN)
```

**🚫 BLOCKED (Dangerous queries)**
```
"Delete company 123?"                   → DELETE FROM Companies WHERE Id = 123
"Update all companies to active?"       → UPDATE Companies SET Status = 'Active'
"Add a new test company?"               → INSERT INTO Companies (...)
"Drop the old table?"                   → DROP TABLE ...
```

## 🛡️ Recommended Solution: Apply Security Patch

### Quick Fix (5 minutes)

**This adds READ-ONLY mode - only SELECT queries allowed.**

```powershell
# Stop the bot
.\stop-sql-bot-v2.ps1

# Apply security patch
.\apply-security-patch.ps1

# Restart with protection
.\restart-sql-bot-v2.ps1
```

**What this does:**
1. ✅ Blocks all UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT/DROP operations
2. ✅ Only allows SELECT queries (read-only)
3. ✅ Logs blocked attempts
4. ✅ Sends friendly message to users explaining why query was blocked
5. ✅ Creates backup of original script

## 📊 Current vs. Protected Behavior

### Current Behavior (UNSAFE)
```
User: "Delete test companies?"
API:  DELETE FROM Companies WHERE Name LIKE '%test%'
Bot:  ✅ EXECUTES → 50 companies deleted!
```

### After Patch (SAFE)
```
User: "Delete test companies?"
API:  DELETE FROM Companies WHERE Name LIKE '%test%'
Bot:  🚫 BLOCKED → Sends security message
      "This bot only supports READ queries.
       For data modification, use admin interface."
```

## 🔒 SQL Injection Protection

### Already Protected (API level)
- ✅ Pattern-based SQL generation (not raw user input)
- ✅ Detects `; DROP TABLE` attacks
- ✅ Detects SQL comments (`--`, `/* */`)
- ✅ Validates WHERE clauses

### Still Vulnerable (Bot level)
- ❌ Bot trusts API 100%
- ❌ No validation before execution
- ❌ Uses string concatenation (not parameterized)

**Security patch fixes bot-level vulnerability.**

## 📋 Action Items

### Immediate (Do Now)
- [ ] Read SECURITY_REPORT.md for full details
- [ ] Run `.\test-security.ps1` to see what will be blocked
- [ ] Apply security patch: `.\apply-security-patch.ps1`
- [ ] Restart bot: `.\restart-sql-bot-v2.ps1`
- [ ] Test with a safe query: "How many companies?"
- [ ] Test with a blocked query: "Delete company 123?"

### Short-term (This Week)
- [ ] Review bot logs for any blocked attempts
- [ ] Consider creating read-only database user (instead of `sa`)
- [ ] Add rate limiting (max queries per minute)
- [ ] Set up user permissions (who can use bot)

### Long-term (This Month)
- [ ] Implement admin approval workflow for write operations
- [ ] Add audit logging for all queries
- [ ] Set up alerting for suspicious activity
- [ ] Consider moving to web interface for data modifications

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Current State:**
- 🔴 Bot can delete/modify ANY data without confirmation
- 🔴 Bot has full database admin permissions (`sa` user)
- 🔴 No protection against accidental data loss

**After Patch:**
- ✅ Bot can only READ data (SELECT queries)
- ✅ All write operations blocked and logged
- ✅ Users notified why queries were blocked
- ✅ 99% of use cases still work (most questions are "how many", "list all", etc.)

**Recommendation:**
Apply the security patch NOW. You can always relax restrictions later with proper approval workflows.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will this break existing functionality?**
A: Only if users are currently doing UPDATE/DELETE via chat (unlikely). SELECT queries work fine.

**Q: What if I need to allow some write operations?**
A: Edit the security check in `sql-bot-v2.ps1` to allow specific patterns, or implement approval workflow.

**Q: Can I rollback if needed?**
A: Yes! The patch creates a backup: `sql-bot-v2.backup.ps1`

**Q: What about the web API?**
A: The API already has good security. This patch protects the Teams bot specifically.

**Q: How do I allow INSERT but block DELETE?**
A: Modify the regex in the security check to only block DELETE/DROP/ALTER:
```powershell
if ($sql -match '^\s*(DELETE|DROP|ALTER|TRUNCATE)') {
```
