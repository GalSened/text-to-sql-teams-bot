- Processes requests automatically
- No manual intervention needed

### 3. Intelligent SQL Generator (`app/services/sql_generator.py`) **NEW!**
- Pattern-based SQL generation
- Supports English and Hebrew
- Common query patterns (COUNT, SUM, SELECT, etc.)
- Upgradeable to AI API (Claude/OpenAI)
- **Fast and FREE**

### 4. Teams Notifier (`app/services/teams_notifier.py`) **NEW!**
- Sends proactive messages to users
- Results formatted in user's language
- Automatic notification when query completes

### 5. PostgreSQL Queue Database
- Stores questions and results

---

## Prerequisites

### Required:
- ✅ Windows 10/11
- ✅ Docker Desktop running
- ✅ Python 3.12+ installed
- ✅ ngrok installed
- ✅ **Your SQL Server connection details**

### Configuration Needed:
Update `.env.devtest` with YOUR database:
```env
# Your Target Database (SQL Server)
DB_SERVER=your-server.database.windows.net  # Or localhost
DB_PORT=1433
DB_NAME=YourDatabaseName
DB_USER=YourUsername
DB_PASSWORD=YourPassword
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Configure Your SQL Server Connection

Edit `.env.devtest`:
```bash
# Update these with YOUR actual database details:
DB_SERVER=your-sql-server-hostname
DB_NAME=your-database-name
DB_USER=your-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-password
```

**Test your connection:**
```bash
python -c "from app.core.database import db_manager; print('Connected!' if db_manager.test_connection() else 'Failed!')"
```

### Step 2: Start the System

Run the production startup script:
```bash
start_production.bat
```

This starts:
1. PostgreSQL queue database
2. FastAPI server on port 8000
3. Background worker (10-second polling)
4. ngrok tunnel

**Important:** Keep the ngrok window open!

### Step 3: Install Teams App

1. **Create Teams app package** (if not done):
   - Add `color.png` (192x192) and `outline.png` (32x32) to `teams-app-manifest/`
   - Update `manifest.json` with your ngrok URL
   - Zip: `manifest.json + color.png + outline.png` → `TextToSQL.zip`

2. **Upload to Teams:**
   - Teams → Apps → Manage your apps
   - Upload a custom app
   - Select `TextToSQL.zip`
   - Add to Teams

### Step 4: Test End-to-End

1. **Ask a question in Teams:**
   ```
   How many customers joined last month?
   ```

2. **Watch the logs:**
   ```bash
   # In Git Bash or PowerShell:
   tail -f logs/worker.log
   ```

3. **Within ~10 seconds:**
   - Worker picks up the question
   - SQL generated automatically
   - Query executed
   - Results sent back to Teams

4. **User sees results immediately!**

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Worker Service Monitoring

The worker logs show:
- Requests being processed
- SQL generated
- Execution time
- Success/failure status
- Error messages

Example log output:
```
2025-10-26 01:00:00 | INFO | Found 3 pending request(s)
2025-10-26 01:00:01 | INFO | Processing request 1: How many customers...
2025-10-26 01:00:01 | INFO | Generating SQL for: How many customers joined...
2025-10-26 01:00:01 | SUCCESS | Generated SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM customers
2025-10-26 01:00:01 | INFO | Executing SQL query...
2025-10-26 01:00:02 | INFO | Query executed: 1 rows, 45.2ms
2025-10-26 01:00:02 | SUCCESS | Request 1 completed successfully
```

### Database Monitoring

```sql
-- Check queue status:
SELECT status, COUNT(*)
FROM sql_queue
GROUP BY status;

-- Recent requests:
SELECT *
FROM sql_queue
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Failed requests:
SELECT question, error_message
FROM sql_queue
WHERE status = 'failed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Performance Tuning

**Adjust worker polling interval:**
```bash
# Faster (5-second polling):
python worker_service.py --fast

# Custom interval:
python worker_service.py --poll-interval 15
```

---

## Upgrading to AI-Powered SQL Generation

The system is designed to easily upgrade to AI APIs for complex queries.

### Option 1: Claude API (Anthropic)

1. Get API key from https://console.anthropic.com
2. Update `app/services/sql_generator.py`:
```python
self.use_ai_fallback = True
self.claude_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```
3. Implement `generate_with_ai()` method
4. Cost: ~$0.01 per complex query

### Option 2: OpenAI API

1. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com
2. Similar implementation
3. Cost: Similar pricing

### When to Upgrade?

Current pattern-based approach works for:
- ✅ Simple COUNT queries
- ✅ SUM/AVG aggregations
- ✅ SELECT with filters
- ✅ Time-based queries

Consider AI upgrade for:
- ❌ Complex JOINs
- ❌ Subqueries
- ❌ Advanced analytics
- ❌ Unusual query patterns

---

## Troubleshooting

### Worker Service Not Processing

**Check 1:** Is worker running?
```bash
tasklist | find "python"
```

**Check 2:** Check logs
```bash
tail -f logs/worker.log
```

**Check 3:** Restart worker
```bash
shutdown.bat
start_production.bat
```

### SQL Generation Failing

**Symptom:** Questions not matching patterns

**Solution:** Check `logs/worker.log` for warnings like:
```
WARNING | No pattern matched, using fallback
```

**Fix:** Either:
1. Add more patterns to `sql_generator.py`
2. Upgrade to AI API for complex queries
3. Rephrase question to match existing patterns

### Database Connection Issues

**Symptom:** Worker logs show connection errors

**Check:**
```bash
python -c "from app.core.database import db_manager; db_manager.test_connection()"
```

**Fix:** Update `.env.devtest` with correct credentials

### Teams Messages Not Sending

**Known Limitation:** Full proactive messaging requires:
1. Storing conversation references
2. Bot Framework authentication
3. Azure Bot Service setup

**Current Workaround:** Users use `/history` command to see results

**Future Enhancement:** Implement full proactive messaging

## Security Considerations

### Production Checklist

- [x] FastAPI validates all inputs
- [x] SQL injection protection (parameterized queries)
- [x] Environment-based restrictions (devtest vs prod)
- [x] Query classification (READ/WRITE/ADMIN)
- [x] User tracking and audit trail
- [ ] Rate limiting (add if needed)
- [ ] IP whitelist (add if needed)
- [ ] HTTPS only (ngrok provides this)

### Database Security

**Recommended:**
1. Use SQL Server with authentication
2. Create dedicated user with limited permissions
3. Grant only SELECT on needed tables (for devtest)
4. Use separate credentials for prod

```sql
-- Example: Create limited user
CREATE LOGIN text_to_sql_user WITH PASSWORD = 'StrongPassword!';
CREATE USER text_to_sql_user FOR LOGIN text_to_sql_user;

-- Grant only SELECT on specific tables
GRANT SELECT ON customers TO text_to_sql_user;
GRANT SELECT ON orders TO text_to_sql_user;
```
